# NSFW Policy

At Leap, we take a strong stance against illegal and unethical use-cases, however we also understand that some legitimate use-cases may require NSFW filters to be disabled.

By default, all projects have NSFW filters enabled, preventing the submission of prompts that may generate explicit content.

Use-Cases Not Allowed:

- Created explicit imagery of others without their consent.
- Creating explicit imagery using fine-tuned models.
- Creating imagery of minors.
- Uploading nudes as image samples when training fine-tuned models.
- Anything illegal in your home country/region.

# Enabling NSFW Generations

If you're only looking to generate NSFW images using public models, you can head over to the project Settings page and toggle NSFW to allow unsafe prompts.

This will only enable unsafe prompts to work on public models. Generating using unsafe prompts in custom models is forbidden.
