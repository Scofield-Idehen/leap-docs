# NSFW Policy

At Leap, we take a strong stance against illegal and unethical use-cases, however we also understand that some legitimate use-cases may require NSFW filters to be disabled.

By default, all projects have NSFW filters enabled, preventing the submission of prompts that may generate explicit content.

Use-Cases Not Allowed:

- Created explicit imagery of others without their consent.
- Creating explicit imagery using fine-tuned models.
- Creating imagery of minors.
- Uploading nudes as image samples when training fine-tuned models.
- Anything illegal in your home country/region.

Paid projects may request NSFW filters to be disabled on pre-trained public models.

If you believe your use-case does not violate this policy, your project is on a paid plan, and you would like to request us disabling NSFW filters on your workspace, please contact us at help@tryleap.ai and provide your projectId.
