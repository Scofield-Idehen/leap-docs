# Create an AI Headshot Generator: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion with Leap API ‚ö°Ô∏è

**You've probably seen AI magic avatars.**

They flooded social networks in November 2022, and ever since we've seen the demand for AI avatar generators skyrocket.

The way this technology works is by using _Dreambooth_ to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model.

While magic avatars for social media a slew of new apps are using fine-tuning for a much wider variety of use cases ranging from Linkedin photos to stylized icons.

In this post, we'll focus on how to make your own AI headshot generator using fine-tuning with the Leap API.

Let's get into it!

## Gather your image samples üì∏

First, you'll need image samples to teach the model what your face looks like.

These are critical. Garbage in = garbage out. Here's what we recommend:

‚Üí Use 3-15 high quality image samples

‚Üí Use only close-up face images

‚Üí 1 person in the frame

‚Üí Avoid sunglasses, hats, etc.

‚Üí Make sure the face is clearly in view (to detect if the face is in view, you can use this api: [https://cloudinary.com/documentation/face\_detection\_based\_transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/face_detection_based_transformations?ref=leap.mymidnight.blog))

## Pre-process Images ‚ú®

Once you have 3-15 samples, we can start pre-processing the images.

_Step 1:_

For headshots or avatars, center and crop your face photos.

We couldn't find a free bulk image cropper. So we built one for you.

Try it out: [https://www.tryleap.ai/crop](https://www.tryleap.ai/crop?ref=leap.mymidnight.blog)

_Step 2:_

After cropping the images properly, we recommend resizing each image to 512x512 using a website like [https://www.birme.net/](https://www.birme.net/?ref=leap.mymidnight.blog)

_Step 3 (optional):_

You can continue refining your pre-processing pipeline with techniques like image upscaling and duplicating the best samples.

## Train your model ü™Ñ

_From Leap Dashboard:_

Once you have your samples pre-processed, you can start training your model on [tryleap.ai](https://www.tryleap.ai/?ref=leap.mymidnight.blog).

Create a new model and upload your samples

<figure class="kg-card kg-video-card"><div class="kg-video-container"><video src="https://cdn.getmidnight.com/0915da4d5aad32cf7f0377582a72cc6e/media/2023/06/Upload-Sampels.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/3024x1728/0a/spacer.png" width="3024" height="1728" playsinline="" preload="metadata" style="background: transparent url('https://cdn.getmidnight.com/0915da4d5aad32cf7f0377582a72cc6e/2023/06/media-thumbnail-ember202.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;"></video></div></figure>

Click train and wait for it to finish processing.

Once it's finished you're ready to start generating your headshots or avatars.

_From Leap API_

To generate from the API, check out the code from the google colab below:

[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v45UprB-fzSeWk4wTnYJEx4dEeW2DnYw?usp=sharing&ref=leap.mymidnight.blog)

## Generate your images üåâ

Once your model is finished, click "try in playground".

You can then enter a prompt or use one of our starter prompts to generate your avatar style:

_Additional Prompting Tips:_

‚Üí see our collection of great starter prompts here ([https://guides.tryleap.ai/guides/stellar-prompts-for-ai-avatars](https://guides.tryleap.ai/guides/stellar-prompts-for-ai-avatars?ref=leap.mymidnight.blog))

‚Üí try ¬†'Prompt Examples' in the dashboard

‚Üí try using the auto-suggested Negative prompt in our dashboard

## Final results üëÄ

This is an example model trained on Kayne West.

You can generate Psychadelic, Fantasy, Professional, Jedi style, and more!

- [Next.js starter project](https://github.com/alexschachne/leap-ai-avatars?ref=leap.mymidnight.blog) that gives you a template to build all of this into an app on top of the Leap API
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v45UprB-fzSeWk4wTnYJEx4dEeW2DnYw?usp=sharing&ref=leap.mymidnight.blog) to run this process with Python
