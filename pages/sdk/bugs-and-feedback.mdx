# Fixing Bugs & Submitting Feedback

Have you come across any bugs or do you have any suggestions for improvements while using our SDK? 

The TypeScript SDK is completely open-source, which means that anybody is allowed to contribute to its development. 

It's designed with contributions in mind, and even if this is your first time, the process is simple.

## Posting Issues on GitHub

If you encounter any bugs or issues, you can post them directly on the project's GitHub page. These issues help us track all the bugs and feature requests in one place. Here's how to do it:

1. Navigate to our GitHub page: [https://github.com/leap-ai/leap-sdk](https://github.com/leap-ai/leap-sdk)
2. Once there, click on the `Issues` tab.
3. Click the `New issue` button.
4. In the form that appears, provide as detailed a description as you can of the bug or issue you've found.
5. Click `Submit new issue` when you're done.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Should you wish to contribute directly to code modifications, you can do this by submitting a Pull Request (PR). These allow you to submit modifications that can be reviewed and potentially integrated into the project. Here's a simple guide:

1. Fork the project: Navigate to [https://github.com/leap-ai/leap-sdk](https://github.com/leap-ai/leap-sdk), and click `Fork` in the top-right corner. This creates a copy of the project in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked project to your local machine.
3. Make your changes in the local copy of the project.
4. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub account.
5. Navigate to the `Pull requests` tab of the original project and click `New pull request`.
6. On the next page, click `compare across forks` and select your forked repository and the branch with your changes.
7. Review your changes and then click `Create pull request`.
