## Generating Music

To generate an image simply call the `music.` method on your `Leap` instance. You must pass in a prompt, and set the duration. 

```ts copy
  const { data, error } = await leap.music.submitMusicGenerationJob({
    prompt: prompt,
    duration: duration,
  });
```

Generating music takes between 30 seconds and 3 minutes in most cases, this depends on the duration you set. 

```ts copy
  const { data, error } = await leap.music.listMusicGenerationJobs();
```
## In Progress

Music endpoint does not yet support webhooks, but we do plan on adding this soon.

Please reach out to help@tryleap.ai and let us know what else you'd like us to add, or if you have any suggestions for how to improve this.
