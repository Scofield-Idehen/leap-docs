# TypeScript SDK

Our TypeScript SDK is the easiest way to get started integrating Leap into your app. It contains built-in methods for generating images, training models, and more.

It enables you to do everything you can with the RESTful API, but with the added benefit of type safety and a more intuitive interface.


* NPM: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@leap-ai/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@leap-ai/sdk)
* Source Code [https://github.com/leap-ai/leap-sdk](https://github.com/leap-ai/leap-sdk)

## Installing

To get started with our server-side SDK, simply install it using your preferred package manager.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm i @leap-ai/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn add @leap-ai/sdk
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Initializing

After installing the package, you can initialize it on your server-side code by initializing a new instance of `Leap`, for example:

```ts copy
import { Leap } from "@leap-ai/sdk";

const leap = new Leap(process.env.LEAP_API_KEY);
```

Consider creating a utility file to initialize the SDK, and then import it into your API handlers for easy access.

```ts filename="leap-util.ts" copy
import { Leap } from "@leap-ai/sdk";

if (!process.env.LEAP_API_KEY) {
  throw new Error("Missing env var: LEAP_API_KEY");
}

const leap = new Leap(process.env.LEAP_API_KEY);

export { leap };
```


<Callout emoji="â„¹" type="info" >
  The Leap SDK is meant to be used server-side. It is important that you do not expose your API key to the client-side, as this would allow anyone to use your account.
</Callout>

## Generating Images

To generate an image simply call the `generateImage` method on your `Leap` instance. You must pass in a prompt, and any other options you'd like to use. 

```ts copy
const { data, error } = await leap.generate.generateImage({
  prompt: "A photo of a cat",
  negativePrompt: "blurry, low quality",
  numberOfImages: 1,
  width: 512,
  height: 512,
  steps: 60,
});
```
By default your image will be generated using the Stable Diffusion 1.5 Model, but you can pass in a different `modelId` if you'd like.

```ts copy
const { data, error } = await leap.generate.generateImage({
  prompt: "A photo of a cat",
  modelId: "eab32df0-de26-4b83-a908-a83f3015e971", // the id of a public or custom model
});
```

For a list of all available public models and their IDs, you can visit the {<a href={internalLinks.publicModels}>public models</a>} page.

Once your generation has completed, you will receive a response with the generation job containing the generated images (if successful). For example:

```ts copy
console.log(data);
```

```bash copy
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2023-07-04T20:55:54.644Z",
  "prompt": "A photo of a cat",
  "negativePrompt": "blurry, low quality",
  "seed": 456465,
  "width": 512,
  "height": 512,
  "promptStrength": 7.5,
  "numberOfImages": 4,
  "state": "finished",
  "steps": 50,
  "images": [
    {
      "id": "img001",
      "createdAt": "2023-07-04T20:56:54.644Z",
      "uri": "https://leap-api-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/.../img001.png",
    },
    ...
  ],
  "modelId": [
    "eab32df0-de26-4b83-a908-a83f3015e971"
  ],
  "upscalingOption": "superResolution"
}
```


### Asyncronous Generation

Depending on whether you're using a serverless backend (such as Next.js) or not, you may need to generate images asynchronously. 

Generating images can be done two ways:
* `leap.generate.generateImage`: Submit generation request, and then wait for results to finish.
* `leap.generate.createInferenceJob`: Submit generation request, and resolve right away.


Awaiting `leap.generate.generateImage` on a serverless environment, may cause your function to time out. If you're using a serverless backend, we recommend using `leap.generate.createInferenceJob` instead.

```ts
const { data, error } = await leap.generate.createInferenceJob({
  prompt: "A photo of a cat",
});
```

When using `createInferenceJob`, you will receive a response with the generation job containing the generation job, but with an empty image array and the status will be set to `queued` or `processing`. For example:

```shell copy
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2023-07-04T20:55:54.644Z",
  "prompt": "A photo of a cat",
  "state": "queued",
  "images": [],
  ... // other fields
}
```

You can then use the `id` of the generation job to fetch the results later on. Or you can take advantage of our webhooks to receive a notification with the job payload when the generation job is complete.
