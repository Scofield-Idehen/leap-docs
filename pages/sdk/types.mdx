# Type Definitions

This section describes the different types that are used across the Leap SDK. They help enforcing the correct structure and validation of the data when you interact with the API, ensuring predictability and stability.

## LeapImageSchema

This type is used to represent an image that has been produced by a Leap inference job. Each image has a unique `id` and a `uri` for locating the image. The `createdAt` field indicates the timestamp when the image was generated.

```ts copy
export type LeapImageSchema = {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for the image
  uri: string; // Uniform Resource Identifier for accessing the image
  createdAt: string; // Timestamp indicating when the image was created
};
```

## LeapInferenceSchema

This type defines the structure of an inference job, including several key fields such as `id`, `createdAt`, `prompt`, `seed` and many more. These various fields provide comprehensive details about the generation job.

```ts copy
export type LeapInferenceSchema = {
  id: string; 
  createdAt: string; 
  prompt: string; 
  seed: number; 
  width: number; 
  height: number; 
  numberOfImages: number; 
  state: "queued" | "failed" | "finished" | "processing";
  steps: number; 
  images: LeapImageSchema[]; // Array of images produced by the inference job.
  modelId: string[]; 
};
```

## LeapModelSchema 

This type provides a blueprint for describing the model used in the image generation process. It includes essential attributes such as `id`, `title`, `subjectKeyword`, and `subjectIdentifier`.

```ts copy
export type LeapModelSchema = {
  id: string; // Model's unique identifier
  title: string; // Model's name
  subjectKeyword: string; 
  subjectIdentifier: string;
};
```

## LeapSampleSchema

This type serves to encapsulate the sample image details. It spans across three parameters - `id`, `createdAt`, and `uri`, providing complete information about a sample.

```ts copy
export type LeapSampleSchema = {
  id: string; // Sample's unique identifier
  createdAt: string; // Timestamp indicating when the sample was created
  uri: string; // Uniform Resource Identifier for accessing the sample
};
```

## LeapVersionSchema

This type demonstrates the versioning information and model details for an image generation process. It includes various attributes like `id`, `createdAt`, `status`, `model`, `weights`.

```ts copy
export type LeapVersionSchema = {
  id: string; 
  createdAt: string; 
  status: "queued" | "failed" | "finished" | "processing"; 
  model: {  // Model details
    id: string; 
    title: string; 
    subjectKeyword: string; 
    subjectIdentifier: string; 
  }; 
  weights: {
    uri: string; 
    id: string; 
  };
};
```

## LeapAPIError

This type is used to handle error scenarios encountered while interacting with the Leap API. It comprises of `statusCode`, `message`, `error` to clearly indicate the nature of the error.

```ts copy
export type LeapAPIError = {
  statusCode: number; // HTTP status code
  message: string[]; // Error description
  error: string; // Error type
};
```
