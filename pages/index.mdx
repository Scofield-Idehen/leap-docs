Learn how to generate images from text. Get started with your API Key from the dashboard. 

<QuickStartCards />

#### Generating images using API
Our text-to-image endpoint generates an image from a text prompt using a given model. The model used to generate the image is determined by the modelId parameter. An image job ID is returned that can be used to retrieve the generated image(s).

We have curated a set of pre-trained, ‘default’ models which everyone can use to generate from [here](https://reference.tryleap.ai/reference/inferencescontroller_create-1). 
You may also use custom models trained via fine-tuning.

To get your custom models use `GET /v1/images/models` with your API key as described in the [Get Models](/api-reference/voices)
endpoint documentation. You will need this ID to query the generete image endpoint.

Here is a `python` example implementing image generation with our pre-trained Realistic Vision model. Get your [API Key](authentication) first
and try it out! You can also run it in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18-hR4ur6cLnYcwCPuYFhIgKjGvVpaUsO#scrollTo=_pXpe_iiCkqq).

```python
import requests
import json
import time

# get api key from Leap AI https://www.tryleap.ai
API_KEY = "ADD_YOUR_API_KEY"

HEADERS = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"
}

def generate_image(model_id, prompt):
    url = f"https://api.tryleap.ai/api/v1/images/models/{model_id}/inferences"

    payload = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "steps": 50,
        "width": 512,
        "height": 512,

        "promptStrength": 7,
        "enhancePrompt": False,
        "restoreFaces": True,
        "upscaleBy": "x1"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=HEADERS)
    data = json.loads(response.text)

    print(data)
    inference_id = data["id"]
    status = data["status"]

    print(f"Inference ID: {inference_id}. Status: {status}")

    return inference_id, status

    images = None

    if len(data["images"]):
        images = data["images"]

    print(f"Inference ID: {inference_id}. State: {state}")

    return inference_id, state, images

# modelID refers to Realistic Vision model. We can now use it to generate images from.
# For more models go here: https://docs.tryleap.ai/reference/pre-trained-models
model_id = "eab32df0-de26-4b83-a908-a83f3015e971"
inference_id, status = generate_image(
    model_id,
    prompt="close up of face of beautiful woman fashion model in white feather clothes, official balmain editorial, dramatic lighting highly detailed, with new york city in the background"
)
while status != "finished":
    time.sleep(10)
    inference_id, status, images = get_inference_job(model_id, inference_id)

for image in images:
    print("Image ready:", image["uri"])
```

#### Creating custom models using API

To use custom models trained via fine-tuning, you can create a new model using the API.

First, you need to specify the type of subject (subjectType) you are training on: person, man, woman, animal, or style. Then choose a name,
and create it as described in 
[Create Model](https://reference.tryleap.ai/reference/createmodel) endpoint documentation.

You will also need a subjectKeyword, which is the keyword you will use during inference (generating images) to trigger the specific styles. We recommend `@me` or our default: `@subject`.


Next, you need to get samples for the model you want to train.
The samples you provide are critical. Their quality plays the biggest role.
Once you have the samples ready, upload them via urls as described in 
[Upload Samples](https://reference.tryleap.ai/reference/samplescontroller_createurl) endpoint documentation. You can also upload the files directly [here](https://reference.tryleap.ai/reference/samplescontroller_create-1).

Finally, once your samples are uploaded successfully, you can queue your model to train as described in [Queue Training Job](https://reference.tryleap.ai/reference/queuetrainingjob) endpoint documentation. 

Training typically takes around 20 mins and you'll get an email when it's ready. You can provide a webhookUrl that will be called when that will be called when the model is done training. You can also specify the baseWeightsId used to train from any of the pre-trained models [here](/public-models).

Once your model is ready, get its ID from the [GET models endpoint](https://reference.tryleap.ai/reference/listallmodels),
and you’re ready to generate images. 

Here is a `python` example implementing custom model finetuning with image generation. Get your [API Key](authentication) first
and try it out! You can also run it in Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v45UprB-fzSeWk4wTnYJEx4dEeW2DnYw?usp=sharing#scrollTo=oh3n9k2M910E).
